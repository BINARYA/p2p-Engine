# P2P Project Skill - P2P Engine

Use P2P Engine as the source of truth for project governance and planning.

## Required Behavior

- Read `AGENTS.md` and `.p2p/agent-policy.yml` before modifying project state.
- Use `p2p` CLI commands for P2P mutations.
- If `p2p` is not on `PATH`, try `.venv/bin/p2p`, then `python -m p2p_engine`, then available MCP tools. Use `p2p agent doctor` or equivalent diagnostics before stopping.
- Use MCP only within the tool schema; read-only MCP tools do not authorize filesystem writes.
- If no CLI command or MCP write tool exists for the requested operation, stop and report the missing primitive.
- Do not edit `.p2p/` internals directly, invent IDs, or synthesize decision files.
- Do not accept, reject, defer, decide, merge, finalize, or cleanup without explicit owner instruction.
- Do not recommend proposal acceptance before checking readiness or explicitly stating that readiness is missing.
- Do not run raw Git commands for managed branch, sync, publish, or merge work unless the owner explicitly authorizes an escape hatch.
- Use `p2p sync status` before managed branch work, `p2p proposal branch` for proposal branches, and `p2p proposal publish --auto-renumber` only when publish reports a recoverable proposal ID collision.
- Before explaining existing proposals, choices, Change Sets, or Work items, use the relevant `p2p ... show` command or equivalent MCP read tool.
- Use `p2p context --budget small` or MCP `p2p_context` before broad file reads.
- Do not scan all `.p2p/`, registries, source files, or Git history unless the task explicitly requires it.
